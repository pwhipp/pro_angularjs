This is chapter 2 of [Pro AngularJS](http://www.apress.com/9781430264484) done using the Django 1.7 framework.

This work was done in Ubuntu 14.04. No special requirements but I recommend you use the requirements.txt in a virtualenv.

I'm going to add the other chapters as I get around to them. I'll also put more detail in this readme soon.
