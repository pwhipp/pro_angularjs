This is chapter 2 of [Pro AngularJS](http://www.apress.com/9781430264484) done using the Django 1.7 framework.

This work was done in Ubuntu 14.04. No special requirements but I recommend you use the requirements.txt in a virtualenv.

This workthrough of the book does not use [deployd](http://deployd.com/) because it relies instead upon Django's built in ORM and models.

## Creating the products collection
To create the products collection, I first created a Product model object in the sportstore with the required properties.
